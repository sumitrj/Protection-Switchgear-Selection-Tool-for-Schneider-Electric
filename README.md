# Protection-Switchgear-Selection-Tool-for-Schneider-Electric

## Introduction:
#### Faults in Electric systems are denoted by ANSI codes. These ANSI codes may differ for different manufacturers and developers.

#### Companies that manufacture switchgears request the customers present their requirements in the form of ANSI codes. 

#### Conventionally, a tendering team is allotted to analyse the requirements and recommend optimal tools from inventory. 

## Requirement:
#### Considering cases of vast companies like Schneider Electric, it is a very tedious job to analyse a huge range of products. Extra Human Resources are being invested here.


## Proposed Solution:

#### A solution to reduce human effort utilized in tendering teams is to make a recommendation system for their assistance. 

#### Part 1:
An algorithm is proposed to prescribe the optimum relay on basis of the specifications given by the customer.
This algorithm is in the the form of a 'Single Line Diagram' SLD, and is integrated with a website based UI. 

#### Part 2:
The algorithm uses the ANSI codes of the protection functions that are specified for the preferred relay and it iterates through the inventory database of all Schneider Electric relay models and prescribes the optimal models for the required specifications.
